# 3.2.10 Repition Statements

# While Loop
# A condition-controlled loop uses a true or false condition to control the number of times that it repeats, 
# like asking a user if they want to continue with their online shopping after they add something to their "basket." 
# while loops test if a condition is true.  If the condition is true, then the code will perfomr a task.  This type of loop has two parts:
#1. A condition that is tested for a true or false value.
#2. A statement or statements that are repeated as long as the condition is ture.
# Example:
x = 0
x = 1
x = 2
x = 3
x = 4
x = 5
x = -2
while x <= 5:
    print(x)
    x = x + 1


# For Loop 
# A count-controlled loop repeats a specific number of times depending on the conditions, 
# such as getting all the items in a list. This type of loop is also called a for loop.
# for loops iterate, or run through, a program a specific number of times before it stops. 
# A for loop can be written like if and if-else statements. 
# Example:
for item in [items]:
    statement 1
    statement 2

#Iterate through Lists and Tuples
# Example
for county in counties:
    print(county)
