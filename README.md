# Election Analysis

## Overview of Project
This project demonstrates mastery of Python through: 
- Creating scripts using VSCode and using the command line that read, writes, and stores data from files or in arrays.
- Perform mathematical operations, utilizing knowledge of variables, arrays, conditionals, Boolean, and loops.
- Understand and appropriately declare variables using the correct Python data types including integers, floating-point decimal numbers, and strings.
- Use decision statements, logical operations for complex comparisons, and repetition statements to run code more than once.
- Write data to screen outputs.



## Background
This project represents a simulation in which, a client and the Board of Elections employee, needed assistance in an election audit tabulating an election of a Congressional district.  They were previously using excel and wanted to automate the process.  The assignment was accepted to help automate the reporting process and create a certified vote count report using Python. The big goal is to use this pilot code and test it, before explaining it to other congressional districts, senatorial districts, and local elections.  The client originally requested the report to include the following:

- The total number of votes cast
- The total number of votes for each candidate
- The percentage of votes for each candidate
- The Winner of the election

 The client submitted the certified vote count report to the election commission. Before rolling out the code to other districts they requested a few additional specifications including:
- The voter turnout per county
- The percentage of votes per county listed with the total count
- The county with the highest turnout

## Deliverables
- Election Results Printed from Command Line (Git Bash)
- Election Results Saved to a Text File (election_analysis.txt)
- This Written Analysis of the Election Audit
